## 1. The Hero Section (Start Here)
**[SCREEN: Top of `index.html`. The "NEXT GEN CREDIT SCORING" Header matches your opening.]**

*   "Good afternoon. We are Team LOQI. This is the future of Credit Risk."
*   "We have built a production-grade Quantum Pipeline on the **IQM Garnet Processor**."


1. The Hero Section (Start Here)
[SCREEN: Top of 
index.html
. The "NEXT GEN CREDIT SCORING" Header matches your opening.]

"Good afternoon. We are Team LOQI. This is the future of Credit Risk."
"We have built a production-grade Quantum Pipeline on the IQM Garnet Processor."
2. The Problem (The "In-Between" Transition)
[ACTION: Scroll down SLOWLY from Hero, stop JUST BEFORE 'Key Achievements'. Talk to the audience.]

"But before we show the results, let's talk about the Problem we faced."
"The Credit Crunch:"
"Real Quantum Hardware is expensive and slow."
"Submitting 2,000 circuits one-by-one would take hours and bankrupt our API budget."
"Most teams just run on simulators and call it a day."
"We refused to do that."
"We built a Batch Execution Engine that reduced API overhead by 99%, making real hardware training possible."
3. Key Achievements (Metrics)
[ACTION: Scroll to the 'Metrics Dashboard' section.]

"And that engineering breakthrough led to these numbers:"
[POINT to 99% Card]: "Here is that 99% efficiency gain. We solved the bottleneck."
[POINT to 89% Card]: "Which allowed us to achieve Proof of Learning on real hardware, reducing loss by 89%."
[POINT to 71.5% Card]: "And importantly, we validated a 71.5% accuracy on real hardware using a parallel validation track."
4. The "Two-Track" Benchmark
[ACTION: Scroll to 'Two Tracks, One Goal' Battle Cards.]

"We didn't just guess. We ran a Two-Track strategy:"
[HOVER over Track A (Red Card)]

"Track A (LOQI) was about Production."
"We optimized for the IQM Garnet chip (20 qubits) using our batching engine."
"This proved the engineering viability."
[HOVER over Track B (Green Card)]

"Track B (Validation) was about Science."
"We used Qrisp to solve the Class Imbalance problem."
"We sacrificed some accuracy to quadruple our recall. This model actually catches bad loans."
5. Visualizations & Conclusion
[ACTION: Scroll to 'Interactive Visualizations' - Click 'Hardware Trajectory']

"Finally, the proof is in the data."
"This blue line is our model learning on the Quantum Chip."
"In just 24 hours, we delivered a solved engineering problem, verified hardware execution, and a business-ready model."
"We are ready to scale. Thank you."
